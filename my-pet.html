<h1>My Pet</h1>
  <p>My pet is a horse. His name is Magan. He is a Nugaal stub and is purely white in color locally known as Qaaje.</p>
  <p>The Nugaal horses are ancestors to  horses that the biblical King Solomon used to ride.
     Magan is powerhouse to say the list. He traverses large swathes of land in little time. Furthermore, he can stay long periods of time without food or water. A testament to its breed.
    However, when he eats he eats and drinks to his fill.
